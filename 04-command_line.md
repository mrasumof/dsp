# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

What does `ls` do? What do `ls -a`, `ls -l`, and `ls -lh` do? What combinations of those flags are meaningful?

ls -a :lists all file names in current directory
ls -l :lists all directories in current directory
ls -lh: lists all directories in human readable size

What does `xargs` do? Give an example of how to use it.

xargs reads input from the standard input, being the keyboard or a chain of unix commands
